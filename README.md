# wp-timber-kint

This one-stop WordPress plugin includes [Kint](https://github.com/kint-php/kint), so that you can use `d()`, `kint()`, etc in your php files. It also defines a Timber function so that you can use {{ kint() }} or {{ kint(somevariable) }} in your twig files.

Timber is not required to use this plugin, but it's super awesome cool and if you haven't yet, you should really check it out :)
